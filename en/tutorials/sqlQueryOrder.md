### SQL Query Order

Language: [English](../../en/tutorials/sqlQueryOrder.md) | Chinese(Simplified)

When you execute a SQL query, the database management system processes the query in a specific order to ensure the correct results. Understanding this order of execution can help you write efficient and effective queries.

The typical order of execution for a SQL query is as follows:

1. **FROM** clause: This clause specifies the tables from which you want to retrieve data. It is the first clause executed in a SQL query. If your query involves more than one table, the database will execute any necessary joins in the next step.

2. **JOIN** clause: If your query involves joining two or more tables, the database will execute the join clause next to combine the data. The join clause specifies how to combine data from different tables based on common columns.

3. **WHERE** clause: This clause specifies the criteria for filtering the data based on certain conditions. The database will apply the WHERE clause to the data resulting from the previous steps in the query.

4. **GROUP BY** clause: This clause groups the results based on one or more columns. The database will group the results according to the columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.

5. **HAVING clause**: This clause filters the results based on aggregate function values. It is similar to the WHERE clause, but applies to the results of the GROUP BY clause rather than the raw data.

6. **SELECT clause**: This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the tables. The database will retrieve the columns specified in the SELECT clause from the data resulting from the previous steps in the query.

7. **DISTINCT clause**: This clause removes duplicates from the results. It is applied after the SELECT clause and before the ORDER BY clause.

8. **ORDER BY clause**: This clause sorts the results in ascending or descending order. It is applied after the SELECT and DISTINCT clauses.

9. **LIMIT clause**: This clause limits the number of results returned by the query. It is the final clause executed in a SQL query.

It is important to note that not all queries will include all of these clauses, and some clauses may be executed in a different order depending on the query. Additionally, some database management systems may optimize the order of execution to improve performance. Understanding the order of execution can help you write more efficient and effective queries, and can help you troubleshoot issues that arise in complex queries.
