# Hard Problems

This page contains a list of **Hard** LeetCode problems sorted by frequency. Each problem includes a link to the problem on LeetCode, and a link to the solution in this repository.

These problems are suitable for users who are advanced in SQL and looking to challenge themselves.

Note that the problems are sorted by frequency, with the most frequently asked problems listed first. 

Hard problems typically involve more complex queries and require a deeper understanding of SQL concepts. These problems may involve window functions, common table expressions, or recursive queries. Don't be discouraged if these problems take longer to solve â€“ they are designed to be challenging!

Here are some tips to help you tackle hard SQL problems:

Understand the problem requirements and constraints before starting to write your query.
Break the problem down into smaller parts and solve each part separately.
Use common table expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.
Use window functions to calculate aggregates over a specific range or group of rows.
Make use of subqueries to filter data and join tables.
Practice, practice, practice!
